Description of each file in this folder:
- DatasetLoader.py: a class on top of speechDataset that makes loading datasets more specific and also simpler.
- data_loader.py: a class to load the fused features from csv files.
- DeepModels.py: the pytorch models of the neural networks
- funcs.py: some useful functions that are used in different other files
- HowToUse.txt: how to train and test the models on the dataset
- ModelWrappers.py: is a wrapper for pytorch deep learning models that trains and tests a neural network defined by the DeepModels.py file.
- preprocess.py: the preprocess file that must be run so that we have the data needed for training a neural net.
- speechDataset.py: a class that handles reading saved data to be used in a pytorch neural network.
- train.py: the high end run file that is being used to train the models.
- test.py: the high end run file that is being used to test the models.
